# linux-kernel-hacks

A collection of tiny kernel modules exploring Linux Kernel APIs around following topics:

1. process_management
2. process_scheduling
3. memory_management
4. system_calls
5. kernel_data_structures
6. interrupts & interrupt handlers
7. synchronization
8. timers    ,and more

Not production code, but instantly pluggable modules, which are experiments or hacks while learning the internals. Modules are arranged directory-wise.

#### NOTE: effort will be put to test on specific kernel versions of these APIs.
